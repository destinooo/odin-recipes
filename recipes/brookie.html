            <li>1 cup (175g) chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h4><em><u>Steps:</u></em></h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C) and grease or line an 8x8-inch baking pan with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Make the Brownie Layer:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, whisk together the melted butter and granulated sugar until smooth.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs and vanilla extract, and whisk until well combined.</li>
            <li>Stir in the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder. Mix until smooth.</li>
            <li>Pour the brownie batter into the prepared baking pan and spread it evenly.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Make the Cookie Dough Layer:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a separate bowl, cream together the softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add the egg and vanilla extract, and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>n another bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chips.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Spoon the cookie dough over the brownie layer, gently spreading it to cover the top. It’s okay if it’s not perfectly even.</li>
        <li>Bake the brookie in the preheated oven for 30-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out with only a few moist crumbs (not wet batter).</li>
        <li>Let the brookie cool in the pan for about 15 minutes before cutting it into squares. You can serve it warm, or allow it to cool completely.</li>
    </ol>
