    <h4><em><u>Steps:</u></em></h4>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat Oven: Set your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>Cook the Meat: In a large pan, cook the ground beef (or sausage) with chopped onion and minced garlic over medium heat until browned. Drain excess fat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Add Sauce: Stir in the marinara sauce, season with salt and pepper, and let it simmer for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Prepare Ricotta Mixture: In a bowl, mix the ricotta cheese, egg, and chopped parsley. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Cook the Noodles: Boil the lasagna noodles according to the package directions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li>Assemble the Lasagna: In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce. Layer 3 lasagna noodles on top. Add a layer of ricotta mixture, followed by a sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Repeat the layers (sauce, noodles, ricotta, mozzarella) until all ingredients are used, finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top.</li>
        <li>Bake: Cover the dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Then remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes until the cheese is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li>Cool and Serve: Let the lasagna sit for about 10 minutes before serving to make slicing easier. Enjoy!</li>
