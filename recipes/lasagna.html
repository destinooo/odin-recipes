    <p> To make a delicious lasagna, start by preheating your 
        oven to 375°F (190°C). In a pan, cook ground beef or sausage 
        with chopped onions and garlic until browned, then add a jar 
        of marinara sauce and simmer for 10 minutes. In a separate bowl, 
        combine ricotta cheese, an egg, and some fresh parsley. Cook lasagna 
        noodles according to the package instructions, then layer in a baking 
        dish: start with a thin layer of sauce, followed by noodles, ricotta mixture,
        shredded mozzarella, and Parmesan. Repeat until you run out of ingredients, 
        finishing with a layer of sauce and cheese on top. Cover with foil and bake 
        for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake for another 25 minutes until 
        bubbly and golden. Let it cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
