    <h4><em><u>Fluffy n Sweet Cinnamon Roll's</u></em></h4>
    <p>
        A sweet, soft pastry made from a yeasted dough that 
        is rolled up with a cinnamon-sugar filling, then baked 
        to perfection. Once golden and puffed up, these rolls are 
        often topped with a creamy glaze or frosting. The combination 
        of the warm, spiced cinnamon filling and the soft, fluffy dough 
        creates a mouthwatering treat that is often enjoyed for breakfast 
        or as a dessert. The aroma of freshly baked cinnamon rolls fills 
        the air, making them an irresistible indulgence.

    <ul>
        <li>For the Dough:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (240 ml) whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>1/2 cup (100 g) granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons (1 packet) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>4 cups (500 g) all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
        </ul>
       
        <li>For the Cinnamon Filling:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup (115 g) unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup (200 g) packed brown sugar</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        </ul>
        
        <li>For the Glaze</li>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (120 g) powdered sugar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons whole milk</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Warm the milk in a small saucepan or microwave until it’s about 110°F (43°C).</li>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the warm milk, melted butter, and granulated sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the active dry yeast over the milk mixture, let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, mix the flour and salt. Add the yeast mixture and eggs, and stir to combine.</li>
            <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 6-8 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can also use a stand mixer with a dough hook for this step.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise for about 1-1.5 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>

        <li>In a small bowl, mix the softened butter, brown sugar, cinnamon, and salt until smooth.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has risen, punch it down to release the air. Transfer it to a floured surface and roll it out into a large rectangle (about 16x12 inches).</li>
        <li>Spread the cinnamon-sugar filling evenly over the rolled-out dough, leaving about an inch border on all sides.</li>
        
        <li>Roll and Cut the Dough</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Starting from one edge, carefully roll the dough into a tight log.</li>
            <li>Slice the log into 12 equal pieces (you can use dental floss or a sharp knife for clean cuts).</li>
        </ol>

        <li>Arrange and Rise</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the cinnamon rolls in a greased 9x13-inch baking pan, leaving a little space between each one.</li>
            <li>Cover the pan with a cloth and let the rolls rise for 30-45 minutes, or until they are puffed and nearly doubled in size.</li>
        </ol>

        <li>Bake the Rolls</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
            <li>Bake the cinnamon rolls for 25-30 minutes or until they are golden brown.</li>
        </ol>

        <li>In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, melted butter, milk, and vanilla extract until smooth.</li>

        <li>Frost the Rolls</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Once the rolls are done baking, remove them from the oven and let them cool slightly.</li>
            <li>Drizzle the glaze over the warm cinnamon rolls.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
